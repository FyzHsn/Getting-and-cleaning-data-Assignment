Experiment Background
---------------------
The raw data is from a Human activity recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing the daily activites: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and lying. The test subjects carried a waist mounted smartphone with embedded intertial sensors. 

Using the accelerometer, the x, y and z-axis linear acceleration, along with 3-axial angular velocity was recorded. The experiements were video recorded to manually decide what activity (walking, sitting, etc.) was taking place corresponding to the data. 

The resulting data set was partitioned randomly into two sets: test (30% of the volunteers) and train (70% of the volunteers).
